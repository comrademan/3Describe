# About 3Describe
This projects involves using the Intel Realsense D435 depth camera to create 3D-AR objects that can be touched with hands through Mediapipe's hand-tracking feature. The main Python file is **3d-describe-video.py**. When the Python runs (with the depth camera), a green 3D cube (or prism if you configure the dimentions in the code) appears and rotates. When the 3D cube/prism is touched, it becomes blue and becomes pushed in the direction relative to angle where the cube/prism was touched
